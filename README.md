# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Background
Helping Jeremy, a data analyst at Mechacar, with the following analysis:
* Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
* Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
* Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
* Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, youâ€™ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.

### Purpose
Using R for statistical analysis.

## Results

### Linear Regression to Predict MPG

### Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

### T-Tests on Suspension Coils

### Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition
